As I have had no experience in using Java to create web applications whilst having no experience in web socket implementation 
within the time I was given I tried to research as much as possible and cover many web application methods mainly directing to the examples given within the code challenge. 

Therefore in this example I'm using vanilla Java to make a single page web application for a local host.  
I understand that it does not work with my C++ application for the machine state notification. 
However, I didn't want to leave an attempt to the challenge task just because I hadnâ€™t had experience in Java web applications. 

Therefore, I have made a hypothetical system that if my C++ application
were to be integrated into this system by changing the machine state within script.js, it would therefore change the web application colour and status accordingly. 

Hypothetical example : is if my set state function within C++ could be integrated into this Java program, 
I would link it to script.js setMachineStateDashboard("A", machineAstate); function.
